# Images Directory
## How to use

If you plan to include images in your site, upload them to this directory.

Then, in your HTML code, your image tag will be:

<img scr='image/Map-of-Spanish-Speaking-Countries.png' alt='image-of-a-map' width="..." height="..."


<img scr='Hello.jpeg' alt='image-of-a-word' width="..." height="..."
